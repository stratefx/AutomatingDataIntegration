# AutomatingDataIntegration

Uses SQL statements to  implement functions, stored procedures, and triggers to prepare data sets for data analysis and manipulation. Configure data extraction,
transformation, and loading tasks in order to automate data integration.


This project creates a repeatable data export, import, and analysis for stakeholders of a ficticious DVD rental business. It provides a report, defined as a collection
of data that answers a real-world business question, that illustrates which customer spent the most money in the store per month.

Demonstrates the following:
-Creating and deleting tables
-Truncate tables
-Populating tables
-Create triggers
-Create stored procedures
-Transform data
-Automatically update tables
-Automatically refresh data

*** Author's note: The code has sections that are not relevant to the task, but rather, relevant to the demonstration video that accompanies it. These sections
of code are for the purposes of clearing and deleting tables in real-time durring the video to verify accuracy. The video can be viewed at
